## Drug consumption</br>
  Drug consumption and addiction are among the largest and most challenging problems facing society today. We now know that drug abuse is preventable behavior, and that drug addiction is, fundamentally, a treatable chronic.
Although we know the magnitude of the problem, what causes a person to drug in the first place? Elaine Fehrman, Vincent Egan, and Evgeny M. Mirkes viewed this question from a psychological standpoint and collected data from 1885 respondents from over seven countries to evaluate how personality traits and demographics affect drug consumption.
In this data analysis task, I use their data downloaded from Machine Learning Repository1 to evaluate and analyze the risk of drug consumption for hard drugs2 by utilizing :</br>
• Data cleaning</br>
• Data visualization</br>
• Modeling</br>
• Dimensionality reduction</br>
Database contains records for 1885 respondents, and for each respondent 12 attributes are known. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. More on [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29]
